Milestone 2

- Create a working connection between the application and an external database. (INCOMPLETE)

We are moving this task down to milestone 3.


- Develope a UI skeleton with non-working components to help visualize the model of our app. (Finished)


- Design characters/avatars to be included in our application. (INCOMPLETE)

We are moving this down to milestone 3 because this is not a priority at the moment. We deemed that the UI Skeleton and Maps should be our main focus as well as the various other UI Elements.


- Side Menu, Profile Page, Avatar Store, About Us (INCOMPLETE)

We have split each task between our group members.

- Map Integration (Partial)

This is still in progress. We got a map to show up and take in our location, but integration into our app is gonna take some more time.

- The ability to take pictures (INCOMPLETE)

We will have to move this down to milestone 3 since it is not as difficult as the other parts of our plan.
