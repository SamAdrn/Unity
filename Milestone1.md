**Milestone 1**

* Create a working connection between the application and an external database. (INCOMPLETE)
    *  We are moving this task down to milestone 2 because we have decided that this task is has the least priority and we need to work on on developing basic UI skeleton first. 
* Develope a UI skeleton with non-working components to help visualize the model of our app. (INPROGRESS)
    * We are still developing the UI skeleton and its taking us a bit longer than expected because we are still figuring out what we want it to look like and we are wrapping up swift UI material in the class. 
* Design characters/avatars to be included in our application. (INCOMPLETE)
    * We are moving this down to milestone 2 because this is not a priority at the moment and we need to focus on the basics of the app.
* Design the UI of the notifications and widget. (INPROGRESS)
    * We are still working on this together with the UI skeleton and we will push our changes to the git once we are done.
