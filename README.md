Unity is an application that brings you closer to your surroundings through technology. This app was developed as a final group project for an iOS Development class at the University of Maryland. It was an overall team effort that led to the success of this project, with members including:
- [Samuel Kosasih](https://github.com/SamAdrn)
- [Nathan Bezualem](https://github.com/nathanb9)
- [Matthew Lee](https://github.com/matthewraylee)
- [Isaac Wu](https://github.com/Iwu0207)

## What is Unity about?

When we created Unity, we thought about how to engage more with our surroundings. Since most of us are always on our phones, why not use it to do just that? So, using our combined knowledge of the Swift programming language and SwiftUI frameworks, we developed an app that brings you motivation to go outside.

The home page consists of a Map that shows where you are within a certain radius. On the bottom left is a steps tracker that acts as a currency within the application to purchase various icons. Users are encouraged to be outside more often in order to gain more currency for the ability to collect all of the app's icons, which can be found in our little mini-store.

Originally, the application was intended to be a lifestyle social media app with the capability of interacting with other users through sharing location-based photography of various landmarks. Users will be rewarded based on the rarity of a certain landmark with a certain form of in-app currency. Unfortunately, limitations of time and experience coerced us to develop a much simpler version of the idea. However, we will be looking into tackling the challenge as we gain more knowledge of mobile development in the near future.

## What you'll find in this repository

All the source code (along the the Xcode project file can be found within the [`Unity`](https://github.com/SamAdrn/Unity/tree/master/Unity) folder. Our code organizes each `View` into its own respective files. Most of the functionality exists in the [`Model.swift`](https://github.com/SamAdrn/Unity/blob/master/Unity/Unity/Model.swift) file.

You can also find our [initial project proposal](https://github.com/SamAdrn/Unity/blob/master/Group%209%20Project%20Proposal.pdf) for this project, and our [final deliverable](https://github.com/SamAdrn/Unity/blob/master/Final.pdf) as we submit for a grade. Screenshots of the application UI can be found in the [`Screenshots`](https://github.com/SamAdrn/Unity/tree/master/Screenshots) folder.
