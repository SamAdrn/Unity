Milestone 3:

Side Menu, Profile, and Map: We changed up the initial idea of a side menu with a bottom tabview for each page. It functions properly and looks nice.

HealthKit Integration: Our application is now fully integrated with HealthKit and takes on the ability to track steps as a person moves about their day.
Its a fun way to stay in shape and track how far you are going. We may use this as a points system to earn coins that can be spent in a store to be used in the future.

The ability to take pictures: We are still working on this feature and its integration with the points system and location tagging. We have opted to not keep pictures between instances of the app with the philosophy that life is fleeting and that sometimes joys only last in the present :).

Profile: We are still working on a cool profile for people to customize with avatars to show off their achievements.
